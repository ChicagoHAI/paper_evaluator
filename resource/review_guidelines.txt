Best Practices
Be thoughtful. The paper you are reviewing may have been written by a first year graduate student who is submitting to a conference for the first time and you don't want to crush their spirits.
Be fair. Do not let personal feelings affect your review.
Be useful. A good review is useful to all parties involved: authors, other reviewers and AC/SACs. Try to keep your feedback constructive when possible.
Be specific. Do not make vague statements in your review, as they are unfairly difficult for authors to address. 
Be flexible. The authors may address some points you raised in your review during the discussion period. Make an effort to update your understanding of the paper when new information is presented, and revise your review to reflect this.
Be timely. Please respect the deadlines and respond promptly during the discussion.  If you cannot complete your review on time, please let the AC know as soon as possible.
Please avoid biasing your review according to discriminatory criteria not having to do with scientific content or clarity. Please avoid wording that may be perceived as rude or offensive.
If someone pressures you into providing a positive or negative review for a submission, please notify program chairs right away.
If you notice unethical or suspect behavior, please notify your AC right away.
